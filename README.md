WheeStat5_4_2
=============

GUI and the GUI source code for WheeStat from July 8, 2014.

The WheeStat is a three electrode potentiostat for teaching electrochemistry and for environmental monitoring.  Directions for using the potentiostat are available at http://publiclab.org/wiki/wheestat-user-s-manual.  A number of other resources are available from the PublicLab website by following the links from the above site. 

The WheeStat is comprised of hardware, Energia code for the Tiva LaunchPad microcontroller, and a GUI that was written using Processing.
The files in this repository are related to the graphic user interface for the instrument. While earlier WheeStat hardware should be compatible with the code herin, the gui softare will only be compatible with microcontroller software WheeStat5.4b or later. 

Inside the main folder is a folder called "application.windows32".  This folder contains the exe file to run the GUI.  In addition to the exe file, you will also need the data, source, and lib files.  These all need to be in the same folder on your computer to run the GUI.  

Double clicking on the exe files opens the GUI.  In addition to the application.windows32 folder, this repository contains the source code for the gui.  The GUI was written using Processing, which can be downloaded from processing.org.
